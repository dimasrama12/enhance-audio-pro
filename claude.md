## 1. Project Overview
- Name : Enhance Audio Pro
- Description : A professional desktop application designed to assist audio and video editors in enhancing, separating, and manipulating audio tracks effortlessly.
- Goal : To provide offline AI-powered speech enhancement, stem separation, and audio manipulation without upload/download limits.
- Target Users: Audio & Video Editors, Podcasters, Musicians, Content Creators.
- Version : v0.1.0 (Initial Setup)
- Status : Active development

---
## 2. Tech Stack
- Language : TypeScript (Frontend) / Python (Backend) / Rust (Tauri Core)
- Framework : Tauri (React) / PyInstaller (Backend)
- Styling : Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (for animations)
- UI Library : shadcn/ui (recommended)
- Database : SQLite (for queue and history management)
- ORM : Drizzle or Prisma (for local SQLite)
- Auth : - (Offline Desktop App, No Auth Required)
- State Management: Zustand (React)
- Data Fetching : Tauri `invoke` (Local IPC calls to Rust/Python backend)
- Package Manager : npm / pnpm
- Deployment : Executable (.exe for Windows, .dmg/.app for macOS)

---
## 3. Commands
```bash
# Development (Frontend & Tauri)
npm run tauri dev      # Run dev server + Tauri window
npm run tauri build    # Build production installer for desktop
npm run lint           # Run linter

# Package Management
npm install [package]  # Install new package

# Python Backend (Audio Processing)
# (Add Python backend commands here later)
```

> If there are package managers that MUST NOT be used, write them here.
> Example: Use npm or pnpm consistently, do not mix them.

## 4. Project Structure
Architecture: By Feature / Clean Architecture
```
[root]/
  src-tauri/       # Rust codebase and Tauri config (OS Windows, IPC)
  src/             # React Frontend codebase (UI, Components, State)
  backend/         # Python codebase (AI Models, Audio Processing, ffmpeg)
  public/          # Static assets (Icons, dummy audio)
```

File placement rules:
- New UI components always in `src/components/`
- Frontend business logic always in `src/lib/` or `src/hooks/`
- Audio processing scripts always in `backend/`
- Do not create new folders in root without prior confirmation

---
## 5. Naming Conventions
```
# Files and Folders (Frontend)
- Components    : PascalCase    e.g., AudioPlayer.tsx
- Non-components: camelCase     e.g., useAudioQueue.ts
- Folders       : kebab-case    e.g., audio-editor/

# Files and Folders (Python Backend)
- Script files  : snake_case    e.g., enhance_speech.py
- Classes       : PascalCase    e.g., AudioProcessor

# In Code
- Variables     : camelCase     e.g., fileQueue, isProcessing
- Constants     : UPPER_SNAKE   e.g., MAX_BATCH_SIZE
- Functions     : camelCase     e.g., processAudio, getQueueList
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase  e.g., AudioFileState
- CSS Classes   : kebab-case    e.g., queue-item
```

---
## 6. Code Conventions
```
# Coding Approach
- Apply DRY & Clean Code principles.
- Avoid blocking the UI thread when processing audio. Call the backend asynchronously.

# TypeScript
- Use strict mode
- Do not use 'any' type
- Always explicitly write function return types

# Import Order (Frontend)
1. External libraries (React, Tauri API, etc.)
2. UI Components / Assets
3. Types and Interfaces

# Error Handling
- Always handle errors on the backend side (Python/Rust) and return easily readable responses to the Frontend.
```

---
## 7. Component Rules
```
# Props Rules
- Always write props types explicitly
- Maximum 5-6 props per component, group the rest into an object.

# React Component
- Use Functional Components.
- Extract small repeating components into their own files if used in more than one place.
```

---
## 8. Styling Rules
```
# Styling Approach
- Use Tailwind CSS.
- Compact and structured according to PRD.
- Do not use inline styles except for progress bars or dynamic animations.

# Animations
- Add micro-animations to every button and card on hover using Framer Motion or Tailwind `transition`.
- Provide smooth transition effects on queue state changes.
```

---
## 9. API & IPC Fetching Rules
```
# Frontend -> Backend Communication
- Because this is an offline desktop app, do not use fetch/axios to external servers.
- Use Tauri `invoke` from `@tauri-apps/api/core` to trigger Python/Rust processing.

# IPC Response Format
- Return a uniform format:
  { success: boolean, data: any | null, error: string | null }
```

---
## 10. State Management Rules
```
# State Hierarchy
1. Local state (useState)   : for UI toggles, form inputs
2. Global state (Zustand)   : for Audio File Queue, Processing Status, Settings (Theme, Language)

# Zustand Rules
- Separate stores: `useQueueStore` for file queues, `useSettingsStore` for user preferences.
```

---
## 11. Performance Rules
```
# Hardware Acceleration
- AI processing (Demucs, DeepFilterNet) MUST attempt to utilize the GPU (CUDA) via the Python backend if available. If not, fallback to CPU.

# UI Thread
- Tauri must not freeze when Python is rendering/processing gigabyte-sized audio files.
- Send progress bar signals (0-100%) from Backend to Frontend periodically.
```

---
## 12. Git Rules
Every time Claude Code finishes making code changes or additions, immediately commit to GitHub before moving to the next task.
```
# Commit Message Format
feat     : [new feature description]
fix      : [fixed bug description]
refactor : [refactor change description]
chore    : [configuration changes, tooling, etc.]
```

---
## 13. Features Progress
```
# Completed and Working
- [x] Draft PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- [x] Initialize Development Rules (CLAUDE.md)

# In Progress — do not change without confirmation
- [ ] Initialize repository (Tauri + React + Tailwind)
- [ ] Setup Backend structure (Python + environment dependencies)

# Not Started
- [ ] Setup UI Shell (Tabs, Layout, Dark/Light Mode)
- [ ] Drag and Drop File Input Feature
- [ ] AI Audio Enhancement Backend logic
- [ ] Stem Separation Backend logic
- [ ] Queue Management Grid UI
- [ ] Audio Manipulation Tools (Trim, EQ, Loop)
```

---
## 14. Testing
```
# Testing Approach
- Testing type   : Unit / Manual
- Framework      : Vitest (Frontend) / PyTest (Python Backend)

# What Needs Testing
- Audio format conversion utilities.
- Integration process of Frontend communication (Tauri) with processes (Python).
```

---
## 15. Do Not
If instructions or prompts are ambiguous, ASK FIRST before starting coding. Do not assume and start working without confirmation.
```
# Structure and Files
- Do not move or delete files without confirmation.
- Do not start modifying `src-tauri` cargo.toml carelessly without knowing the Tauri version used.

# Code
- Do not process audio files by modifying the original file. Create a duplicate (output file) in the destination folder.
- Do not hardcode system directories (use dynamic local OS path APIs).

# Internet
- Do not use APIs from the internet for Audio processing. Everything must be local.
```

---
## 16. Environment & Path Settings
```
# Local Configuration
- Save preferences (Theme, Default Output Folder) in local SQLite or Tauri Plugin Store's built-in JSON config.
- Do not store temporary exported files in RAM, write to OS local storage / temp folder to prevent Memory Leaks on large files.
```
